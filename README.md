# Investigating-airbnb-team6

## Short project description: 
For this teamassignment we are going to investigate data from the Airbnb site. There are different datasets available for a lot of cities worldwide. In each dataset, there is information about characteristics of the Airbnb, reviews, prices etc. We decided to use the data from Amsterdam. Currently, the inflation in the Netherlands is very high. Therefore, we decided that it is relevant to look at the prices of Airbnb's in Amsterdam. We deciced to investigate the effect of different host characteristics on the height of the prices of an Airbnb. Examples of characteristics that will be investigated are host_since, host_response_time and host_response_rate. The full regression will be given in the method section.

## Research question: 
What is the effect of different host characteristics on price?

## Research method:
We will be using the OLS regression method to examine the price determinants of Airbnb's in Amsterdam. As the dependent variable, we will take price. The independent variables will be host_since, host_response_time, host_response_rate, host_is_superhost, host_has_profile_pic and host_identity_verified.
